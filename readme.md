# Wearable Sanitizer

An Open-source, On-body Sanitizer for the Pandemic

Disinfection of hands and frequently touched surfaces is an important factor in preventing the spread of viral diseases such as COVID-19, as well as the common cold and flu. But that effort typically requires a great degree of discipline, and presents an inconvenience in terms of the mental and physical effort involved in frequent washing of hands or use of a pocket sanitizer. We developed an open-source, wearable sanitizer that provides just-in-time automatic dispensing of alcohol to the wearer’s hand or nearby objects using sensors and programmable cues, and it seamlessly integrates with the user’s body and behavior and frees their physical and mental faculties for other tasks. 

**Here you will find the complete set of instructions, design files, and software to make one for yoursef.** We also highly encourage you you to make modificatins, changes, and imporovements to the hardware and software, and take this open-source project to the next level. And if you, please let us know, so we can add you as a contributor to the project.
